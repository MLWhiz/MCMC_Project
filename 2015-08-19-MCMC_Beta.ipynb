      "\n",
      "##**So what really are MCMC Methods?**\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all we have to understand what are ***Monte Carlo*** Methods!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Monte Carlo methods derive their name from the Casinos in Las Vegas. There are many card games that need probability of winning against the dealer. Sometimes calculating this probability can be mathematically complex or highly intractable. But we can always run a computer simulation to simulate the whole game many times and see the probability as the number of wins divided by the number of games played.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that is Monte carlo Methods. Yes they are just simple simulation with a Fancy Name.\n",
      "\n",
      "So as we have got the first part of it, we also need to understand what are ***Markov Chains***.\n",
      "Before Jumping onto Markov Chains lets learn a little bit about **Markov Property**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose you have a system of $M$ possible states, and you are hopping from one state to another.\n",
      "*Markov Property* says that given a process which is at a state $X_n$ at a particular point of time, the probability of $X_{n+1} = k$, where $k$ is any of the $M$ states the process can hop to, will only be dependent on which state it is at the given moment of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And not on how it reached the current state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mathematically speaking:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ P(X_{n+1}=k | X_n=k_n,X_{n-1}=k_{n-1},....,X_1=k_1) = P(X_{n+1}=k|X_n=k_n)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "If a process exhibits the Markov Property than it is known as a Markov Process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Why is a Markov Chain important? \n",
      "1. It could tell us the probability that the system is in, if we know the current state of the system.\n",
      "2. Another reason it is important is because of its **stationary distribution**.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what is a **Stationary Distribution**?\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Intuitively you can think of it as an random walk on a chain. You might visit some nodes more often than others based on node probabilities. In the *Google Pagerank* problem you might think of a node as a page, and the probability of a page in the stationary distribution as its relative importance.\n",

      "Now Let's Talk about the intuition. For the Intuition I am quoting an [Answer](http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/12657) from the site Stack Exchange,as this was the best intuitive explanation that I could find:\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "I think there's a nice and simple intuition to be gained from the (independence-chain) Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.\n",
      "<br>\n",
      "<br>\n",
      "First, what's the goal? The goal of MCMC is to **draw samples from some probability distribution** without having to know its exact height at any point(We don't need to know C). The way MCMC achieves this is to **\"wander around\" on that distribution in such a way that the amount of time spent in each location is proportional to the height of the distribution**. If the \"wandering around\" process is set up correctly, you can make sure that this proportionality (between time spent and height of the distribution) is achieved.\n",
      "<br>\n",
      "<br>\n",
      "Intuitively, what we want to do is to to walk around on some (lumpy) surface in such a way that the amount of time we spend (or # samples drawn) in each location is proportional to the height of the surface at that location. So, e.g., we'd like to spend twice as much time on a hilltop that's at an altitude of 100m as we do on a nearby hill that's at an altitude of 50m. The nice thing is that we can do this even if we don't know the absolute heights of points on the surface: all we have to know are the relative heights. e.g., if one hilltop A is twice as high as hilltop B, then we'd like to spend twice as much time at A as we spend at B.\n",
      "<br>\n",
      "<br>\n",
      "The simplest variant of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (independence chain sampling) achieves this as follows: assume that in every (discrete) time-step, we pick a random new \"proposed\" location (selected uniformly across the entire surface). If the proposed location is higher than where we're standing now, move to it. If the proposed location is lower, then move to the new location with probability p, where p is the ratio of the height of that point to the height of the current location. (i.e., flip a coin with a probability p of getting heads; if it comes up heads, move to the new location; if it comes up tails, stay where we are). Keep a list of the locations you've been at on every time step, and that list will (asyptotically) have the right proportion of time spent in each part of the surface. (And for the A and B hills described above, you'll end up with twice the probability of moving from B to A as you have of moving from A to B).\n",
      "<br>\n",
      "<br>\n",
      "There are more complicated schemes for proposing new locations and the rules for accepting them, but the basic idea is still: **(1) pick a new \"proposed\" location; (2) figure out how much higher or lower that location is compared to your current location; (3) probabilistically stay put or move to that location in a way that respects the overall goal of spending time proportional to height of the location. \"\"\"**\n",
